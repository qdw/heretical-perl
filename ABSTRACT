Catalyst is the leading web MVC framework for Perl. Normally, Catalyst apps
use an ORM to communicate with the database. While ORMs can be convenient,
they can also hurt performance, tie your app to one database schema, and make
complex queries difficult.

But this is Perl, and TMTOWTDI applies: There's More Than One Way To Do It.
In this talk, I'll take you through the code of a working Catalyst app that
uses stored procedures rather than ORM queries as its interface to
PostgreSQL. Along the way, I'll touch on a number of useful modules and
pragmas such as DBIx::Connector, aliased, Template::Declare, and Test::XPath.
