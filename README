These are the slides for “Heretical Perl:  Writing Catalyst Apps with No ORM,”
a talk I gave at PostgreSQL Conference West 2010 (see the ./ABSTRACT).

==> If you're among the 99% of people who just want to view the slides, go to
http://quinnweaver.com/heretical-perl.html .

If for some reason you want to play with the slides yourself, you'll need
showoff, the presentation platform on which they run.  Please also drop me a
note (although the LICENSE doesn't require you to do so); I'm always interested
to know what people are doing with my stuff.
