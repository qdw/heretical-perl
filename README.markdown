These are the slides for “Heretical Perl: Writing Catalyst Apps with No ORM,” a talk I gave at [PostgreSQL Conference West 2010](https://www.postgresqlconference.org/2010/west).  See the ./ABSTRACT.

*If you're among the 99% of people who just want to view the slides, go to [http://quinnweaver.com/heretical-perl.html](http://quinnweaver.com/heretical-perl.html).*

If for some reason you want to hack on the slides yourself, you'll need [showoff](http://github.com/schacon/showoff), the presentation platform on which they run.  Please also drop me a note (although the LICENSE doesn't require you to do so); I'm always interested to know what people are doing with my stuff.  Thanks!
